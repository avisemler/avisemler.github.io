## About me

Hi! I'm Avi, and I'm interested in AI safety, historical linguistics, maths, and computer science.

## Publications
1. **[Implicit Regularization of AdaDelta](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nm40lbbwoR)** (Matthias Englert, Ranko Lazic, *Avi Semler* - equal contribution)

## Other things
 - [Blog](https://manateeofmanatees.substack.com/) about various things I'm interested in
 - [Using AI to detect emotions from images of eyes](https://substack.com/@manateeofmanatees/p-145666394). I evaluated CLIP embeddings and multi-modal language models for this task
 - Agent-based [simulation of congested systems](https://github.com/avisemler/vectorised_q_learning) such as transport, originally developed in 2023 as part of the University of Warwick Undergraduate Research Support Scheme and then vectorised with PyTorch
 - Notes on some things I've learnt ([graph algorithms](/files/graphtheory.pdf), [neural networks](/nnnotes/))
 - [Simulator of the enigma machine](https://github.com/avisemler/enigma_simulator), using Python to implement the behaviour of the military 3-wheel enigma machine.
 - [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/avisemler/game_of_life), implemented with pygame
