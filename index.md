## About me

Hi! I'm a maths and computer science student with interests including maths, statistics,
deep learning (safety), programming, and linguistics.

## Projects and writing
 - [Notes on deep learning](/nnnotes/), written whilst reading the book '[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)'. It includes the basics of multi-layer perceptrons, training with back-propogation, and the decoder-only transformer architecture.
 - [Using AI to detect emotions from images of eyes](https://substack.com/@manateeofmanatees/p-145666394). I tested out some approaches to classifying images including CLIP embeddings and multi-model language models, attaining 72% accuracy.
 - [Agent-based simulation of congested systems](https://github.com/avisemler/agent_simulation) such as demand for traffic, completed in summer 2023 as part of the University of Warwick's undergraduate research support scheme: ![Agent Plot](/agent_plot.png){: width="10%"}
 - [Notes on graph algorithms](/files/graphtheory.pdf). Written whilst taking a course on the topic, including summaries and intuition for some common algorithms, along with proofs of their correctness and complexity.
 - [An article about part-of-speech detection using Markov chains](https://issuu.com/poincaremagazine/docs/issue_1) for Poincare magazine, introducing a simple way to determine the meaning of words in a given context. (Note: contains some mistakes!)
 - [Simulator of the enigma machine](https://github.com/avisemler/enigma_simulator), using Python to implement the behaviour of the military 3-wheel enigma machine.
 - [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/avisemler/game_of_life), implemented in Python with pygame:

 - Basic [phylogenetic tree generator](https://github.com/avisemler/Phylogeny), using neighbour-joining and Levenshtein distance
![Tree](/files/mytree.png){: width="40%"}
 - Shader for Panda3D game engine:
