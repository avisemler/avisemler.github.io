Hi! I'm currently a maths and computer science student. My interests include
machine learning, AI safety, and linguistics.

## Projects

 - [Simulator of the enigma machine](https://github.com/avisemler/enigma_simulator), using Python
 - [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/avisemler/game_of_life), implemented in Python with pygame:
