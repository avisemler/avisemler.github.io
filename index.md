# About

Hi! I'm Avi and I'm currently studying maths and computer science. On this page, you can see some of the things I've done.

# Projects

 - [Simulator of the enigma machine](https://github.com/avisemler/enigma_simulator), using Python
 - [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/avisemler/game_of_life), implemented in Python with pygame:

# Notes

I've written notes about some topics that I've learnt about:

 - My [solutions to exercises and notes](/nnnotes/) for the book [http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
 - [Some useful results from basic graph theory](/files/graphtheory.pdf)
 - [Bounds on half-Ramsey numbers](/files/Probabilistic_Ramsey_Numbers.pdf), a generalisation of Ramsey theory
